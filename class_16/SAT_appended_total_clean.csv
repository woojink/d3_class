Newly built science and engineering labs offer up-to-date equipment, and all classrooms have internet access and computers or laptop carts. Students are drawn from all five boroughs of NYC and hail from diverse ethnic backgrounds. When students graduate, they are prepared for college and for life beyond by HSMSE's in-depth approach to learning. New York State Regents exams, while required, are viewed as minimal competencies which our students are expected to master. Our curriculum exceeds the state standards in every way. Most HSMSE courses are taught at the advanced, AP and college level, and some courses earn college credit from The City College of New York. Students select one of three concentrations at the end of 10th grade, taking advanced coursework in either Advanced Engineering, Biomedical Research or Mathematics in 11th and 12th grades. HSMSE also offers a variety of elective classes and academic teams across departments.
